# Pescador 2 - React Refactor - Client

A water and weather condition dashboard and journal for anglers of all styles.

This project was originally built in the PEN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, EJS, and Node. The final product lacked much of the functionality
I set out to include and EJS made laying out a UI a bit clunkier than I'd have liked. After learning React, it seemed a much better option for this
application.

## Tech Stack

React | MongoDB | Node | Express | Apollo GraphQL | Recharts | MapBox

APIs: US Geological Survey Water Data, Google Geocoding, OpenWeather, FIPS County Code

## User Story

I am an angler who fishes in the US.

I need to see current and past data for specific waterways - namely: streamflow, gage height, lake height above datum, surface temp where available.
    - I would like this data presented in a dynamic graph
I need to see past, current, and forecast weather information for a selected area.
    - I would like to access weather maps - radar, wind speed/direction
I need to log fishing trips and subsequent catches
