# Pescador 2 - React Refactor

A water and weather condition dashboard and journal for anglers of all styles.

This project was originally built in the PEN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, EJS, and Node. The final product lacked much of the functionality
I set out to include and EJS made laying out a UI a bit clunkier than I'd have liked. After learning React, it seemed a much better option for this
application.

## Tech Stack

React.js | MongoDB | Node | Express | Apollo GraphQL | Recharts | MapBox

APIs: United States Geological Survey Water Data Service API, the OpenWeather API, FIPS County Code API

## User Story

I am an angler who fishes in the US. I need a single service that provides current and forecast weather, conditions for my favorite waters, and a way to journal my fishing trips.

I need to see current and past values for specific waterways.
I need to see past, current, and forecast weather information for a selected area.
